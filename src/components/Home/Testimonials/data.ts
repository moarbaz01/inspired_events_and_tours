    review: `Just got home from Our Trip across France, Germany ,Austria and Switzerland with Inspired events and we are hooked !Fantastic trip ! A proper bucket list tick !
From The Battle fields of Northern France, to the beautiful scenery of Austria and Germany to the incredible Swiss Alps including Furka pass (which if your a Bond fan is a must) everyday is a wow ! Cant recommend this trip highly enough !
With So many highlights the list would go on and with the freedom to find your own way from hotel to hotel it’s certainly an adventure you have full control of ! You can blast the Autobahns or take the scenic routes , and in Adam you have a font of knowledge and advice to help you plan day to day !
A very worthwhile trip and will be going again !`,

    review: `Hi i chose the trip to france switzerland austria at the end of september beggining of october so my guess the weather wouldnt be that great, firstly Adam he is a character easy to get on with guy, i enjoyed everyday of the trip apart from the weather not being to my liking, i had the pleasure of meeting some nice people along the way and visited some landmarks some of which was not accessible by motorcycle or closed until a certain date. This  was my first experience of doing something like this  i would certainly do it again earlier in the year. This trip is not for the faint hearted 8 hrs in the saddle, my opinion adam maybe the trip extended and a couple of hotels closer , zell am see is a must in the trip a beautiful place thats all folks and enjoy your trip. Thanks adam for everything you did A++++++++`,

    review: `
      Right from the point of receiving detailed and specific information about the campsites and the routes through to leaving the campsite at Inverness at the end Adam was excellent with a very friendly, approachable and friendly nature. He made sure everyone was happy and settled with the tents and campbeds. Adam took a personal interest in making sure everyone had the best trip and experience possible. Adam planned and provided everything perfect, he even supplied perfect weather and made sure the midges stayed away. What more can you ask for. Superb job Adam well done and thank you. Even the cost was ridiculously reasonable.We would recommend Adam without hesitation and we would go an another trip organised by him anytime.
