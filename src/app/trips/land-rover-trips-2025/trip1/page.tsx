              Tangier-Rest Day Our road trip to Africa really starts today at
              our campsite near Tangier.This city is the meeting point between
              North Africa and Europe. Tangier is unlike anywhere else in
              Morocco. It can be boisterous, brash but always fascinating. It is
              rich in the tradition of providing refuge to many maverick western
              writers, artists and musicians, from the likes of Henri Matisse to
              Mick Jagger, even today the alleys of the old Medina seem to hold
              their secrets close. Today is a free leisure day to explore the
              historical city of Tangier. We have arranged local guides to show
              us around the markets and places of interest. This is the safer
              option rather than doing it on our own, than potentially wandering
              off the correct paths etc. We will drive to a central meeting
              point before our guide joins us for the day. I&apos;m sure that after
              an amazing day in this historic city we will be happy to return to
              our campsite for a well earned rest and settle in for our second
              night camping in Africa. If you do not wish to join us on the
              guided tour of Tangier you are obviously welcome to spend the day
              exploring on your own and catch up with us back at the campsite.

              Casablanca-Rest Day Today brings a well earned rest day in the
              world famous city of Casablanca. We have again booked the services
              of a local guide to take us round this historical city. Our guide
              will be with us for the morning and rejoin us after lunch. You
              can&apos;t visit Casablanca without visiting Ricks Cafe for lunch,
              famous for its part in the Film Casablanca starring Humphey
              Bogart. More details regarding Ricks Cafe available from
              www.rickscafe.ma. After lunch our guide will collect us in to
              continue our exploration of this amazing city. And as before in
              Tangiers we will regroup at 7pm to return to our camping ground.
              In the 7th century, Casablanca was a small amazigh settlement
              named Anfa. However for strategic, and commercial reasons, it
              started to attract the attention of foreign powers and in 1468 it
              was attacked by the Portuguese who brought wholesale destruction
              to the city. It wasn&apos;t until the 18th century when the city was
              rebuilt. In the 20th century the Spanish name Casablanca was
              adopted. Thanks to its harbour the city grew into the Casablanca
              we recognise today due to its pivotal role in sugar,tea,wool and
              corn markets of the Western World.The futuristic buildings and the
              colossal Hassan II Mosque sending laser beams towards Mecca
              expressed the city&apos;s forward-looking spirit. Famous for its
              Mauresque architecture that took inspiration from the Moorish
              style that many European cities found so fascinating.

              Casablanca-Marrakech 250 km We will spend the morning in
              Casablanca with a visit to The Hassan II Mosque. The Hassan II
              Mosque was completed in 1993 in the memory of King Mohammed V. Its
              minaret is the world’s tallest at 210 metres with 60 stories
              topped with a laser whose light points in the direction of Mecca.
              This is the largest mosque in the country spread over more than 9
              hectares and is one of the largest in the world. The Mosque is
              strategically facing the Atlantic Ocean and can be seen from far
              away. Its décor is lavish with hand-crafted marble and a
              rectangular roof. The site is open for Muslims and non-Muslims
              although there are some restricted areas of this historical
              monument. In the afternoon we will head towards Marrakech, a
              former imperial city in western Morocco, it is a major economic
              centre and home to mosques, palaces and gardens. The medina is
              densely packed, walled mediaeval city dating to the Berber Empire,
              with maze-like alleys where thriving souks (marketplaces) sell
              traditional textiles, pottery and jewellery. A symbol of the city,
              and visible for miles, is the Moorish minaret of 12th-century
              Koutoubia Mosque. Our route will see us travel through Settat
              where we can grab some light refreshment from one of the many
              restaurants and eateries in this bustling city. We will regroup at
              5pm and re-join the road to Marrakesh before travelling to our
              evening camp @ Rouler Campsite

              Marrakesh-Rest Day Today follows the same format as our previous

              city or you are welcome to fly solo and meet us back at our
              evenings campsite. Marrakech has an energy all its own (there&apos;s a
              reason it&apos;s one of Morocco&apos;s most well-visited cities). To get
              right to the heart of things, wind your way through its busy
              Medina—the walled, historic neighbourhood that serves as the
              city&apos;s main square. Fair warning, it can be a bit intense, but
              while there, you can fully immerse yourself browsing souks for
              local wares, taking in the Moorish architecture, and filling up on
              street food. On the slower end of things, places like Le Jardin
              Secret, Bahia Palace, and the famed technicolor Jardin Majorelle
              give some breathing room alongside seriously gorgeous scenery

              over sand dunes to our next desert camp where there are showers,
              toilets and food tents serving us local food and traditional
              Moroccan Tea. Erg Chigaga is situated about 5 hours south of
              Marrakech. Chigaga is not a mainstream destination. It appeals to
              those seeking adventure, something unique, something off-grid. The
              camp is 50 miles off-road from the nearest town, M’Hamid. The ride
              to the camp requires a 4WD and takes you through sand, dried-out
              lakes and rocky terrain. Its location ensures there are no tour
              buses or mass tourism. More often than not you can climb to the
              top of the dunes and see no one. It offers perfect solitude and
              tranquillity, a real feel of being in Africa.

              was inhabited by Romans and Arabs until the 12th century.
              Plasencia&apos;s Parador de Turismo (Inn) is located in an old convent,
              where visitors can enjoy the best food in Caceres in the most

              stunning town we continue to drive towards Valladolid via
              Salamanca The old city of Salamanca is now a UNESCO protected
              World Heritage Site with all of its beautiful Plateresque
              architecture including the 2 stunning cathedrals, the Catedral
              Vieja (Old Cathedral) and the Catedral Nueva (New Cathedral), an
              amazing 23 churches, beautiful palaces such as the exquisite
              privately-owned Palacio de Monterrey, well-preserved convents and
              monasteries including the Convento de San Esteban and several
              university colleges. Depart Salamanca at 6pm for our campsite near
